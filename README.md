# iManage

## Creation
iManage was created in response to a growing trend among younger generations striving to enhance their personal development. While many apps have been developed with self-growth in mind, the majority tend to be either overly complicated or lacking in feature variety, often leading users to abandon their journeys or have to download multiple apps. iManage addresses these challenges by offering a simple yet versatile tool designed to focus on three core areas of improvement: intelligence, fitness, and lifestyle.

## What it does
Within the app, users will find daily habit trackers for activities like water intake, calorie consumption, and other metrics to support their healthy daily goals. A to-do list feature was also added that allows simple, accessible task management helping users to stay organized throughout their day.

For the fitness section, iManage offers a customizable workout plan complemented by a progress graph, enabling users to visualize their improvements in weights, reps, and overall performance over time.

Additionally, the app includes a personal journal to encourage self-expression and provide a pomodoro clock for focus management. To further support personal growth, a library feature allows users to track books theyâ€™ve read and bookmark thoughts, creating a seamless way to reflect and grow intellectually.

## How we built it
We built iManage using SwiftUI, leveraging @State, @Binding, and animations to create an interactive experience. Features like circular progress bars, journal editors, and book tracking were implemented with user-friendly design principles. The app also uses modular views to ensure flexibility and maintainability.
